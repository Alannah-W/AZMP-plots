# AZMP-plots
Code created when I was with DFO Canada, creates scatterplots for a variety of variables in the Atlantic Zone Monitoring Program. Plots were generated as a summary for Quality Control purposes to visualize any bad data points in the dataset.
The AZMP cruises sample in the fall and spring, so the plots are separated by season, then within each season are the following variables: Nitrate, Phosphate, Chlorophyll, Silicate, Salinity, and Oxygen.
